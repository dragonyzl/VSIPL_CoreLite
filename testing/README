This is a feel good test. To use, after the 
library is built, type
make

Then type
test_cl >out

edit out and search for the word 'error'. If 
not found the test passed.

If an error is found there is no easy way to 
find out what caused it exactly. Go to where the
error occurs in the output of test_cl (here called out)
 and scroll up to find the test name. Review the output 
of the test to see if it can be detemined what caused 
the error. Edit the header file (test_name.h) associated
with the test to find out what vsipl calls are used
and to get a clue as to where the error may have
accured. It could be that the error bounds are too
small for the platform being tested. Check this first.

If you are totally lost and are getting an error 
feel free to email me with pertinent information and
I will try to help.


When the code is shiped this code worked without error
on a linux workstation, and on a Sun server.

Note not every function or oportunity for error is tested.
Support functionality is tested by using it.
